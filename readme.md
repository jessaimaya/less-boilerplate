# LESS Html5 Boilerplate
LESS boilerplate is an HTML5, CSS3 boilerplate for starting up quick projects using the best standards.

LESS Boilerplate is one of the only front-end framework built on top of LESS that allows for generable,
flexible, and fluid grid systems.  The grid can be generated and configured in real-time,
and it can even be set to work with Bootstrap's grid syntax.

Included is a bare LESS directory structure, designed to provide you with the basics for creating a light-weight,
cross-browser compatible website.

## Features
* **Configurable**, comprehensive ``variables.less`` file.  Change your site's look in seconds only by adjusting any
of the colours
* Generated, **automated grid system**, just like Bootstrap, but fluid, for real; no ``px``, just percentages.
* Includes CSS3 PIE for **IE 6-8 Compatibility**
* Uses ``em`` over ``px``, for **scalability**
* **Icomoon integration** with LESS variables already set up.  It's a basic pack that should serve most apps.  Vector
 of course, and they work with IE7... out of the box!
* Integrated **Bower support** and config file, with the basics: Modernizr, jQuery to get you started quick
* **Live previewing** and configuration using LESS.js
* **Optimized media queries**, with nothing in them, so you can just dive right in
* Already set up with **Google Fonts**.  Just replace the ``href`` in ``index.html`` to get the font you want,
and adjust ``variables.less``
* Includes **Modernizr** for polyfills, if needed

## Installation
In order to get configuring LESS Boilerplate on your local machine, you will need one of two things:

1. Chrome (or Chrome Canary) with the ``--file-access-from-files`` flag set to true.
2. A server like AMPPS

### Windows
To set this up on Chrome on Windows, right-click on your shortcut to Chrome, navigate to the Shortcut Tab,
and on the shortcut area, append ``--allow-file-access-from-files`` to the link.  Restart Chrome.

### Mac/Unix
To get the file-access-from files flag working on Chrome for Mac or unix-based operating systems, open a terminal,
and type the following:

```
chromium --allow-file-access-from-files
```

Make sure that you have restarted Chrome.

## Contributing
If you have some time on your hands, please message me.  I need to find more people to work on this,
and I am currently not able to put in as much effort as I'd like to on this amazing project.  Your pull requests will
 be recognized immediately.  If you have an idea, please make a new issue, or let me know.

### Coming Soon
Looking to use Grunt, combined with YeoMan generator to quickly scaffold out new applications.

# LESS Html5 Boilerplate
LESS boilerplate is an HTML5, CSS3 boilerplate for starting up quick projects using the best standards.

Included is a bare LESS directory structure, designed to provide you with the basics for creating a nice website.

## Features
* Configurable, comprehensive ``variables.less`` file.  Change your site's look in seconds only by adjusting any of the colours
* Generated, automated grid system, just like Bootstrap, but fluid, for real; no ``px``, just percentages.
* Includes CSS3 PIE for IE 6-8 Compatibility
* Allow immediate UI debugging with live.js (also included)
* Uses ``em`` over ``px``
* Comes with and uses a customizable, generable form of Andy Taylor's 1140 grid system.  Optimized media queries,
with nothing in them, so you can just dive right in
* Already set up with Google Fonts.  Just replace the ``href`` in ``index.html`` to get the font you want, and adjust ``variables.less``
* Includes Modernizr for polyfills, if needed
